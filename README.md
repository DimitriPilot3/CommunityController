# What even is this?

This is the source code that I used for CommunityController or as it was better known for. Twitch Plays Nintendo Switch or even Twitch plays Super Mario Odyssey! This houses all of the files that I used to make it possible so that both our Community can improve the code so that the stream can become bigger and better, and also so that others can innovate on this project and create their own bots!

## What can I do with this?

I'm glad you asked! Since this bot only uses a simple Python script(seriously check it out, a child could learn it!) You can do a pletora of things, like making a rudimentary TAS bot for your favorite game, or even creating a bot to duplicate & sell items so that you can have virtually an infiite amount of gold!

## This is great, but what's the catch?
No catch at all! Unless of course that you count me asking for credit, and a link back to this repo within your Project if you use it as one. 

## Is there a discussion thread or anywhere that I can go for support, or to share my work? 
Of course there is! You can find a [gbatemp thread for this bot here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/communitycontroller-pro-controller-python-bot.528158/)

## Known bugs
1. Serial Connection Randomly Closes and will not reopen. A dirty fix is to start the main.py file with a looping shell script like I did in CommunityController
2. The left thumbstick is not completly centered. This is fine in most cases but it will cause some oddities in some games. Such as not being able to navigate the map in Breath of the Wild, and not allowing you to Warp in Super Mario Odyssey. In some games it may even make the character Drift forward however I have only encountered this in the Nintendo Switch version of Fortnite
